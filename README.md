# Introduction

This project will contain the build-automation for creating LVM-enabled Enterprise Linux AMIs for use in AWS envrionments. Testing and support will be given to RHEL 8 and CentOS8. Other EL8-derivatives should also work, but will not be specifically tested.

## Status

This project is currently a stub. No content, beyond this README will be found here until well after CentOS.Org has published an official/final CentOS 8 AMI (see [CO8 Build-Status](https://wiki.centos.org/About/Building_8)) and the Fedora project has made EPEL8 available (see [EPEL 8 Support Status](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#What_packages_and_versions_are_available_in_EPEL.3F)).

Anticipated project start date is not until at least a month after the prior two conditions have been met.
